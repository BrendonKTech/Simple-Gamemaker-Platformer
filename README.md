# Simple Platformer Game Project 

Welcome to my basic GameMaker game!  
This is a small project I added features to, to experiment with game development in GameMaker. It currently features **2 simple levels** and the core gameplay mechanics. While it's not a full-fledged game, all the necessary files are provided so you can download, open, and play it using GameMaker.

## Getting Started

To run the game:

1. **Download or clone** this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BrendonKTech/Simple-Gamemaker-Platformer.git
